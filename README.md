## Node.js Official Site Clone

### Overview

This project is a clone of the Node.js official website, focusing on replicating its design and layout. It aims to provide a similar user experience to the original Node.js site.

### Features

- **Home Page:** Mimics the structure and content of the Node.js official site's home page, including sections like the latest news, downloads, and resources.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling the page and making it visually appealing.

### Current Status

The home page design looks great on a laptop but is not yet responsive. It may not display correctly on tablets or mobile phones.

### Future Improvements

- **Responsive Design:** Make the home page look good on all devices, including tablets and mobile phones, by using media queries and flexible grid layouts.
- **Additional Pages:** Add other pages like documentation, community resources, and more to expand the website.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the home page.

### Contributions

Contributions to improve responsiveness and add new pages are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
